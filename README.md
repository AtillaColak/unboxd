<i>**PS**: if you're not seeing the full icon logo, why are you using github on light mode to begin with?</i>

## What's this? 
A Letterboxd browser extension to make the retrospective film logging process painless. Something like this is especially annoying if you are new to the app and you have a ton of movies you've watched and would've liked already logged in your newly created account. Given that's an impossibly arbitrary ideal, **unboxd** is closer to it than any existing solution get.

## Collaboration (or Contact)
If you'd like to contribute to unboxd (which is an open-source extension to begin with), email me and I'll grant you access to the repository. 

## Further Improvements 
If there's enough demand, I'll update unboxd in the future and improve it with new functionalities I already have in mind. So the version available in the chrome store is the first version. 

## TODO TODAY
* fix the logo and finalize the webstore-related design implications. 
* more code documentation and modularization. 
* Optimize the code. (such as making sure smart naming is called once per movie since it's costly timewise.)
* improved the error handling and more fail-safe code.
